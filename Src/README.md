Datadroid v1.0 beta

Written by Alvise Spanò (C) 2017 Universita' Ca' Foscari Venezia


Datadroid is an Android Java library offering wrappers and utilities for
several Android components and widely-used APIs, including Google Maps.

The library offers a level of abstraction over the typical Android application architecture, transparently performing a number of tasks for dealing with
open-data-related mechanisms, allowing the programmer to write code faster and deliver quality apps easily and quickly.

It includes a prototype sub-library that wraps the core Android API in a strong-typed fashion, using generics and type constraints over type parameters to perform a number of
static checks over Activity and Intent usage via the Java compiler: code written using such typed wrappers tends to be less bugged, lowering testing time and development time in general.
